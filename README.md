## Usage

### 1. Registration and Login
- **Register** with your name, email, username, and password.
- **Log in** to access the cipher tools.

### 2. Select a Cipher Tool
- Navigate through the **sidebar** or use the **card containers** on the homepage to select a cipher or encoding tool.
- Input the text that you want to **encrypt** or **decrypt** as needed.

### 3. Results
- The **results** of the encryption or decryption process will be displayed in a dedicated area beside the input field.

### 4. Favorites
- You can **mark** your frequently used ciphers as **favorites** for easy access later.
- These **favorites** will be displayed in a separate section for quick selection.

### 5. History
